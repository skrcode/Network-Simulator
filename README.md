Linear networks of varying and highly volatile bandwidths are networks with links whose capacity of carrying data changes a lot due to presence of many physical parameters. 
Bandwidth volatility can also occur due to factors such as Bandwidth Throttling due to interference from the Internet Service Provider or due to congestion of networks. 
Consequently, it becomes extremely difficult to estimate throughput for a particular flow. In a channel consisting of links of varying bandwidths, the link of minimum bandwidth determines the throughput of the channel. 
Hence, estimating the throughput when the link bandwidths are known and are varying constantly with time is a difficult challenge. 
This project, simulates the currently used naive methods and a more efficient method using segment trees for throughput estimation.
